    <p>Well, I have never been on a date before, but I've always wanted to have<br>
      that experience with someone special, someone whom I admire a lot. All<br>
      those movies, series, and reels that I've watched, I got to one thing that I<br>
      would love to have that feeling that they get when they are out with<br>
      someone they love, and me being me want to give this FIRST DATE of my<br>
      life all that I got.♡
